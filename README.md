# Disease Symptom Prediction

**Introduction**

This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of predicting possible diseases based on a set of symptoms provided by the user. By analyzing the relationship between symptoms and their corresponding diagnoses, the model assists in early detection and decision making for medical professionals and patients.
The approach involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature encoding, and applying classification algorithms such as Random Forest to achieve accurate predictions. Special attention is given to model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable results.
